Notes on getting ACROBOTIC SSD1306 library working on 'F030F4P6 with SoftWire I2C

ACROBOTIC library is lightweight and is easily run on the 'F030F4P6,
either with native Wire (Pins PA10, PA9), or with SoftWire for choice of SDA / SCL.

Here is how to adapt to SoftWire:

In ACROBOTIC_SSD1306.cpp, add 2 lines near top:

	#include "SoftWire.h"
	extern SoftWire Wire;
	
This configures it to use SoftWire instead of native Wire.


In each example .ino file, you need to replace ...

	#include "Wire.h" 

... at top with these 3 lines  ...

	#include <SoftWire.h>
	SoftWire Wire(PA6, PA5);  // your choice of SDA / SCL pins
	char ibuffer[60];

... and add this inside top of setup():

    Wire.setRxBuffer(ibuffer, 60);  
    Wire.setTxBuffer(ibuffer, 60);
